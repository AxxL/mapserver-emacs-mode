*mapserver-mode* is an Emacs mode for editing [[http://www.mapserver.org][MapServer]] mapfiles.

This mode allows syntax-highlighting and code-indentation when a Mapserver
mapfile is opened in Emacs.

Please report issues directly via Github or via the mapserver-users
list. There are still some issues around.

Supports Mapserver 7.0.0.

* Installation

Grab the neccessary file at:
[[https://github.com/AxxL/mapserver-emacs-mode/blob/master/mapserver-mode.el]]

Put it into: $HOME/.emacs.d/lisp/

You need to add the following lines to your $HOME/.emacs.d/init.el

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(autoload 'mapserver-mode "mapserver-mode" "Mode for editing UMN MapServer files." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.map\\'" . mapserver-mode))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you haven't specified your load-path it is a good idea to do it now. Put
the following line before the other two lines.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some help for Emacs is available at the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/][Emacs Wiki]].

* Background

This file is a fork of Hal Muellers mapserver-mode which he announced nearly
[[http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/mapserver-users/2004-May/051493.html][10 years ago at the mapserver-users list]]. I simply updated the keywords and
constants to the newest version and adjusted the regular expressions a bit.

The original file seems to be based on the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ModeTutorial][Mode Tutorial by Scott Andrew
Borton]]. See also the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SampleMode][Sample Major Mode example by Stefan Monnier]] if you want
to write your own mode.

In combination with yasnippet and auto-complete-mode you should have a nice
way to edit mapfiles in your beloved Emacs environment.


* Files in this Git repository

There are some files in this Git repository that you don't need but which I
wanted to have in this Git.

The *screenshot* directory contains a screenshot. You don't need this directory.

The *tmp* directory contains the ways to get to the regular expressions used
in this mode. Follow the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ModeTutorial][Mode Tutorial by Scott Andrew Borton]] if you want to
know what happens here.

You only need the [[https://github.com/AxxL/mapserver-emacs-mode/blob/master/mapserver-mode.el][mapserver-mode.el]] file. The other stuff isn't neccessary.


* Issues

Some issues might still exist but all in all this mode should give you a
better overview over your mapfile.
